description: Key art of a space ranger who gets left behind on their final expedition

**The Last One Standing** is inspired by **No Man's Sky** and **The Martian**. This piece depicts a lone ranger left behind during a space exploration mission, watching a rocket ascend into the fiery sky. I focused on creating a mood of isolation and resilience using color theory. Bold reds and oranges evoke tension and urgency, contrasted with cooler tones for depth and balance. The lighting and shadows were carefully crafted to emphasize the environment's scale and the moment's emotional gravity.
